# IOP-116 — App navigation

## Status

Proposed

## POC delivery applicability

Owner-approved scope refinement under [IOP-142](IOP-142-poc-delivery-scope.md),
2026-09-15. The revised Goal, Requirements, Acceptance criteria and Dependencies
control the selected slice; older general platform prose is future context, not
an additional POC gate. See [POC scope](../../product/scope-poc.md) and
[delivery map](../poc-delivery.md). No implementation is claimed.

## Milestone

M15 — UX & Operational Experience. Proposed delivery slice.

## Goal

Navigate between import, Executive Overview and analytical detail.

## User / business value

Technicians, managers and administrators need consistent, accessible workflows.

## Context

Scope: Cross-module user experience. See [modules](../../architecture/modules.md) and
[planning workflow](../workflow.md). This initial context comes from the
owner-requested outline; backlog membership does not authorize implementation.

## Current state

Only the documentation baseline exists. This capability is not implemented and its detailed design is not accepted.

## Desired state

Navigate between import, Executive Overview and analytical detail.

## Requirements

- Deliver only the selected POC slice or explicitly deferred future scope below.
- No administration or role-specific landing page prerequisite. Keep controls
  understandable and scope/filters visible; navigation does not grant server permission.

## Acceptance criteria

- [ ] Navigate between import, Executive Overview and analytical detail.
- [ ] Validate the slice-specific outcomes and limitations in Requirements.
- [ ] Record evidence and synchronize the story/plan; do not close a broader parent with
  unfinished future scope.

## Domain considerations

Compose existing modules according to role; visible navigation does not grant server permissions.

## Architecture constraints

[ADR-0001](../../architecture/adr/ADR-0001-modular-monolith.md),
[ADR-0003](../../architecture/adr/ADR-0003-postgresql.md),
[ADR-0004](../../architecture/adr/ADR-0004-authentication-abstraction.md),
[ADR-0005](../../architecture/adr/ADR-0005-customer-isolation.md) and
[ADR-0007](../../architecture/adr/ADR-0007-planned-workflow.md).
Proposed ADRs are proposals, not permission to adopt their decisions.

## Security considerations

Verify customer/site permissions and scope for relevant operations and references.
Do not include secrets, floor plans or production data in the repository. Keep
industrial integrations read-only; record material changes where applicable.

## Data considerations

Views consume authorized contracts and do not create divergent copies of entities.

## API considerations

Reuse search/read contracts; define pagination and limits only for the selected scope.

## UI considerations

Evaluate keyboard use, labels, contrast and empty/error/loading states on laptops and tablets; agree on verifiable targets.

## Dependencies

[IOP-017](IOP-017-frontend-bootstrap.md).

Dependencies require only their relevant POC contracts/slices, not completion of
all future parent capabilities. Runtime business access also requires an accepted
local execution-context mechanism; Proposed ADR-0018 is not yet that acceptance.

## Non-goals

Implementing adjacent tasks, accepting open decisions by inference or extending delivery to the entire milestone. Do not introduce customer names into the core.

## Validation

The plan must specify executable commands and scenarios for the following criteria using the accepted tooling. Include the expected path, errors and relevant access denial; record actual results, not fictitious tests.

## Documentation impact

Update this item, its status in the [backlog](../backlog.md) and the execution plan.
Update contracts, model, guides or ADRs only if this task changes their content.

## Open questions

Confirm the approved contract, edge cases and exact evidence for this slice before activating implementation.
