# IOP-057 — Personal schedule view

## Status

Completed — implemented and validated through IOP-184.

## Scope and authorization

M6 — Workforce & Shift Management. Expected outcome: Technicians can see their assignments.
The owner authorized the full M6 implementation on 2026-09-30 through
[IOP-184](IOP-184-m6-workforce.md), including local commits without intermediate
confirmation. This replaces the earlier documentation-only proposal.

## Delivered behavior

Technicians open their own day by default, see their imported schedule and assignment, and inspect colleagues by zone plus separate leaders and floating/maintenance duties. Their API grants are read-only.

Teams, shifts and assignment rules remain generic. Current Halle names and
Springer wording belong to site configuration/presentation, outside the core.
See the canonical [product contract](../../product/workforce.md) and
[implementation/import guide](../../development/workforce.md).

## Acceptance and evidence

- [x] Technicians can see their assignments.
- [x] Scoped server authorization, site-time semantics and relevant conflicts are implemented.
- [x] Final validation and synchronized documentation are recorded in the
  [M6 execution plan](../completed/IOP-184-m6-workforce-plan.md).

## Dependencies and boundaries

[IOP-055](IOP-055-shift-assignments.md), [IOP-028](IOP-028-local-authentication.md)

This delivery uses existing scoped identities and Accepted ADR-0014, ADR-0016,
ADR-0032 and ADR-0036 patterns; it does not accept Proposed decisions or complete
broader dependency stories by inference. Corporate connectivity, payroll,
automatic roster optimization and inference of partial absences remain outside
this increment. Owner acceptance of the operational product remains a review step.
