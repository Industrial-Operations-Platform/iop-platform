# IOP-072 — Asset link

## Status and authorization

Completed — local implementation under [IOP-194](IOP-194-maintenance-asset-history.md).
M8 — Maintenance Management. The owner's explicit 2026-10-05 request authorizes full implementation
and delegates design choices on an isolated review branch. This replaces the
initial proposed slice; M9 remains excluded.

## Goal and behavior

Expected outcome: Maintenance → asset.

Maintenance validates stable same-site asset references through an Asset-owned port and retains label snapshots.

## Acceptance

- [x] Maintenance → asset.
- [x] Planned scenarios, actual validation evidence and synchronized documentation
  are recorded in the [execution plan](../completed/IOP-194-maintenance-asset-history-plan.md).

## Boundaries and dependencies

[IOP-068](IOP-068-maintenance-record.md), [IOP-034](IOP-034-asset-lifecycle.md)

Dependency refinements and exclusions are recorded in the
[delivery scope](IOP-194-maintenance-asset-history.md). The
[product contract](../../product/maintenance-assets.md) owns behavior and permissions;
the [development guide](../../development/maintenance-assets.md) owns operation.
